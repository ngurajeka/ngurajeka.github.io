      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m In Love.
Few days ago i started to use ReactJS more frequently to write a client side of an application.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been known ReactJS since years ago, but i&amp;rsquo;ve never been using it before to build some application.
This whole year i was just writing codes for Backend because that was my job. And honestly, back then i hate javascript.
I hate the Frontend kind of thing, hate the frameworks, hate all of the things about Frontend development.</description>
