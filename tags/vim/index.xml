      <description>Are you using MacVim and using CtrlP plugin?
Have you ever found that pressing ctrl+p is not easy on mac?
For me, it is faster when pressing cmd+p instead of pressing ctrl+p.
That&amp;rsquo;s why i think i have disable or remap the key. In the official repository of CtrlP has been explained very well to changed this keymap.
But, if you are using MacVim replacing the key to cmd+p is not as easy as it looks like.</description>
