      <description>Recently i used Gorilla Mux as my http router in Go. For your information, gorilla mux is one of the popular http router in Go Programming Language.
It happens when i&amp;rsquo;m trying to write a new microservice in go, and i&amp;rsquo;m ended up using go-kit. Go-Kit is a great tools when it comes to Microservices, especially in Go.
The microservices is still using REST as the communication mechanism, thats why the service itself served using gorilla.</description>

      <description>Today i was having a problem with my web api in Go. A lot of my API&amp;rsquo;s are cached by the browser because the Expires time of the response was automatically set to 4 days than the first request.
The expires time was a header information from the response, if you are not familiar with this. You can use
curl -XGET -i http://url/api/endpoint  Or you can use the network inspector on modern web browser such as Google Chrome or Firefox and other.</description>
