      <description>Ansible is one of the best tool when it comes to deployment and any related things as well. I&amp;rsquo;m using ansible to deploy my website, and a few of my projects.
Using git modules on Ansible is quite easy, for examples:
- name:pullthelatestcodefromgitgit:repo:https://github.com/username/repo.gitdest:/path/to/remote/dirWith a simple configuration, the git module will clone or update the from repo to the destination directory. Thats if your repository is Public.
But, if you&amp;rsquo;re trying to use the very same method for Private Repository, you&amp;rsquo;ll got an error that you have no rights to access the repository.</description>

      <description>Are you using Git to manage your code? Have you ever heard of hooks? pre-commit hook?
Git is one of many version control that exist nowadays. Git helps developer, programmer, engineer to manage their code, versioning their project, library or even just as file storage.
Hook is an operation that could be executed before, or after our main operation.
So pre-commit is an operation that executed right before the commit processed on git.</description>
