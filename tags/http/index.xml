      <description>Today i was having a problem with my web api in Go. A lot of my API&amp;rsquo;s are cached by the browser because the Expires time of the response was automatically set to 4 days than the first request.
The expires time was a header information from the response, if you are not familiar with this. You can use
curl -XGET -i http://url/api/endpointOr you can use the network inspector on modern web browser such as Google Chrome or Firefox and other.</description>
