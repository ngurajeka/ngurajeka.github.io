      <p>I&rsquo;m a workaholic based on <a href="http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20161017-how-to-tell-if-youre-a-workaholic">http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20161017-how-to-tell-if-youre-a-workaholic</a>.
Although i&rsquo;m a workaholic, its never been my intention to work for money. I&rsquo;m working cause i love doing it.
I love to learn, solving problems, get new challenges, improve myself, and many more.</p>

<p>I remember when i became a Teacher in my high school, i was very excited to be on the school everyday.
It&rsquo;s not because i need to be there, it&rsquo;s simply because i wanted to be there.
I want to learn more, learn from the other Teachers, learn from my Students.</p>

<p>I do remember when i&rsquo;m working in a government office in Bulukumba.
It&rsquo;s not because i needed the money, it&rsquo;s because i love to learn something new.
And btw, this is my very first job that i can have my own computer setup.</p>

<p>Actually i had my own income since high school, lots of part time job that i did at that time.
Starting from repairing other people&rsquo;s cellphones to their computers.
All i care was getting new knowledges and challenges.
I remember once i had to flash a blackberry using Linux, which i never done before.
And you know what? I don&rsquo;t even own a Blackberry that time.
So it&rsquo;s a really big challenge, gambling maybe. Cause i didn&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s gonna work or not.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a decade since i have this interests on new things, new challenges, and along the way i found some friends that really help me to get and to become the best version of myself.
Lot&rsquo;s of them are giving me chances to learn, to improve, to become what i am.</p>

<p>Even now, i&rsquo;m pursuing the same thing. It&rsquo;s the knowledge, it&rsquo;s the challenges.</p>

<p>4 years ago, i moved into Jakarta not because i want more money from my previous job.
It&rsquo;s because i need more challenges, need to meet more people. And my family and friends support me to pursue my dream.
That&rsquo;s why i took it.</p>

<p>When the first time i moved into Jakarta, i tell my employer that i&rsquo;m not working for money.
I&rsquo;m working for something else, i want more experiences, and challenges.
You know what he said? &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll train you to become an enterpreneur&rdquo;.
Even though i didn&rsquo;t really understand what is an enterpreneur at that time, or maybe even now. Hahaha
He train me well, he push me to learn new things out of my comfort zone.</p>

<p>Everytime i find someone that has potential, i always said &ldquo;don&rsquo;t work for money, you&rsquo;re still young. Use your time to find something more meaningfull&rdquo;.</p>

<p>2 years ago, i met with this guy who is really good at business.
He started his own company from 2012, and now it&rsquo;s our company.
I met with him randomly, and actually has a same dream.</p>

<p>Since then, i learn a lot of new things.
Learn to build the company, learn how to do things that i haven&rsquo;t done before.
I&rsquo;m a computer guy and now learn to run the company.
Well, this post won&rsquo;t enough just to tell you how many things that i learn in the past 2 years. Hahaha.
He really gave me the time to learn things that i&rsquo;m not good at, and now i&rsquo;m still learning hopefully improving.</p>

<p>Me and him want that everyone can learn, can improve, can build their career, can have more experiences.
